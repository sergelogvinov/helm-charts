Kubernetes RBAC

The chart automatically creates default roles and role bindings for users, either in a specific namespace or across the entire cluster.
It has default permissions for the admins, developers, and viewers.

- ClusterAdmins have permission to read everything and can also create, change, or delete less important resources. The default Kubernetes cluster-admin role is very powerful and can be risky if not used carefully.
- Developers can see all resources in the cluster and delete pods, but they cannot create or change any other resources.
- Viewers can only look at resources in the cluster but cannot make any changes.
